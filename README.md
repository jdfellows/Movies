# Movies

Create a new dynamic web project and build a Java web application that allows users to enter movies into a database. The application should allow users to view all movies unsorted, sorted by title, and sorted by length in minutes. Users should also be able to search movies by title, and by director. 

All JavaServer Pages (JSPs) should use JSP Expression Language (EL) and JSTL appropriately. Java Servlets should be used as Controllers to handle requests from the user interface and provide appropriate responses to users.
